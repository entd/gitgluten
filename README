This project is used for easy and quick autodeployment from git.
It is unstable as hell, do not use in production. You have been warned.
This server is based on python asyncio.
Planing to add support for both bitbucket and github api.
It is intended as simple not fully pleged CI system.
It is probably not safe too.
I'm not responsible for damage, even if it eats kittens.
So far it may not even work and look worse than yesterday spaghetti in dumpster.
License? Probably BSD, MIT or LGPL will depend on my own mood :)
